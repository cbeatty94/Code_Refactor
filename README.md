A digital marketing agency by the name of "Horiseon" has contracted me to refactor their code in order to ensure their codebase meets accessibility standards and is optimized for search engines. The new code needs to meet the following criteria: 

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
